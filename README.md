# NoteArc
#### A minimalistic guitar tuner and pitch detector


this project is my first android app and the submission for cs50 2020.
thank you david and tommy !

created using 
 - [TarsosDsp](https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP) (TarsosDSP is a Java library for audio processing)  .
 - [material.io](material.io) for theming 
 - [material-intro-screen](https://github.com/TangoAgency/material-intro-screen) for intro sequence.
# Functionality
 - Tune standard 6 string guitar (E A D G B E).
 - Note detection , so that you can do other tunings aswell.
 - frequency detection , using which tuning can be more accurate.
 - minimalistic simple ui .

Let's start with some really basic introduction to music theory and guitars. But at first we have to define some important musical terms as an exact distinction will avoid some ambiguities:

1. The  **frequency**  is defined as the reciprocal of the period duration of an repeating event. For example, if we have a sinusoidal signal with a period length of 2ms, the frequency is 500Hz.


2. **Pitch**  is the perceived frequency of a sound. Thus, in contrast to frequency which is physical measure, the pitch is a psychoacoustical measure. This distinction is needed as there are cases where we hear frequencies which are physically not there (or don't hear frequencies which are actually there).

3.  A  **note**  is just a pitch with a name. For example, the well known A4  is a pitch at 440Hz. It can also carry temporal information like whole notes or half notes, but this is rather uninteresting for us.


let take a look at guitar and how it works.

I guess most of you know this but the "default" guitar has 6 strings which are usually tuned in the standard tuning _EADGBE_. Whereby each note refers to one of the strings.

now , guitar has raised bars over fretboard called as FRETS.
the distance between 2 frets is called as a HALF STEP.

_fn  = f0  * (2)<sup>i/2</sup>_

i- number of half steps between these two frequencies
fn - current frequency
f0 - standard frequecy
now we use this formula to calculate HALF steps (i) from standard frequency f0.

if we try to get i on one side , we get 

12â‹…log<sub>2</sub>(fn/fo) = i

# implementation 
### 1 . 
Now we take audio from mic and process it to find the fundamental frequency.
before that , lets look at fundamental frequencies and algorithms to find it.
![](https://www.chciken.com/assets/guitar_tuner/example1_dft.svg)
as you can see , an instrument produces multiple frequecies even tho there is silence .
to find the fundamental frequecie , you need [pitch detecting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_detection_algorithm#:~:text=A%20pitch%20detection%20algorithm%20(PDA,the%20frequency%20domain%2C%20or%20both.) )

we will be using FFT_YIN , which is already provided in TarsosDsp library i mentioned before.


#### 2 . 
now we got the fundamental frequency , now we can use the formula i mentioned before to calculate the half steps .

using half steps , we can simple find the note and ocatave as we already know the standard frequency or the standard note

here, 440hz  , A<sub>4</sub> note is the standard frequency . we can count the number of steps from there to find the current note.

#### 3 .
now just match you current frequency to standard one to tune ;)
